# Einsteinbot

A discord bot that at the moment chooses a random qoute of Albert Einstein and sends it, if you write "%qoute".

## How to use

No guarantee of success, but I think you should do the following:

0. Make sure you have node installed.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create your own discord bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications
3. In the bot section of your discord application you can find your token. Copy it into a new file called "token.secret" in the cloned repository.
4. Open that link, but replace INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE with your client id, to add the bot to a server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=1812987073 
5. type `node .` in the terminal, then you can use the bot.
